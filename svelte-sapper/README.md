# Template backslide/remark Devoxx France

It uses [backslide](https://sinedied.github.io/backslide), which itself uses [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/).

## Install

Run `npm i`.

## Run

Run `npm start` to start the server with live reload. Edit the `index.md` file to see the magic !

## Export

Run:

- `npm run export` to export the presentation as a static html file.
- `npm run pdf` to export the presentation as a pdf (does not work on my machine, but I am on Linux, so maybe I just need to compile my kernel ^^).
